This file lists the instructions to run the project BD_Assignment_4

----Author----
Sneha Bangar 

----Description----
Part1 - > This implements the "in-mapper" combining design pattern for the Wordcount problem using the book files that we downloaded for the assignment 1.A hashmap is used to keep track of intermediate results from mapper.

Part2- > This implements stripes approch to find the coocurrnce matrix for each word on the line(document).

---Library used---
	NA.
----Class Details----

1. WordCount_InMapper .Java
   This class implements the "in-mapper" combining design pattern for the Wordcount problem using the book files that we downloaded for the assignment 1.
   

2. Stripes.Java
   This is the class which runs a map reduce job to find the coocurrnce matrix for each word on the line(document).The number of neighbors is assumed as 7.
   It also takes as parameter , a number that limits words by their length. 

----Run in Command Line----
Command line run format to run on hdfs -
#Run WordCount_InMapper 
hadoop jar BD_Assignment_3-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar BigData.BD_Assignment_4.WordCount_InMapper  <input> <output>

for example-
hadoop jar BD_Assignment_4-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar BigData.BD_Assignment_4.WordCount_InMapper /user/ssb151030/books hdfs://cshadoop1/user/ssb151030/asgn4_part1_op
#Run Stripes

hadoop jar BD_Assignment_3-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar BigData.BD_Assignment_3.Stripes <input> <output> -limit <Length of words> -skip <stop word file>

for example -
hadoop jar BD_Assignment_4-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar BigData.BD_Assignment_4.Stripes /user/ssb151030/booktext.txt hdfs://cshadoop1/user/ssb151030/asgn4_part2_op -limit 5 -skip stop_words.txt

---Results----
Part 1 Output Report -
In Mapper word count -> Duration : 19
Word count with combiner -> Duration : 20 

Part 2 Output format -> <word> {<word>:<count>,<word>:<count>}
for example -
slides {Big : 1, Data : 2, test : 4}
 
I have included the outputs generated by map reduce job for each part.Also including the stop words file for part 2.
